Brucon 2019 Badge Snake game
============================

Because it uses a Nokia screen, and everybody remembers this snake
game Nokia phones used to have, right ?

Well, this small implementation is not optimized and does not match
the original one from Nokia, but it still funny to play !

I rewrote the LCD driver to allow fast screen refresh, added support
of a framebuffer, but did not have time to add font support :(. 
Anyway, feel free to install the Espressif Development Kid for ESP32
and compile this small application.
